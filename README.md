# x86 Assembly Matrix Initialization and Display

This x86 assembly program demonstrates the initialization and display of a matrix. Written in the x86 assembly language, the program uses a combination of data and text sections to handle matrix creation and printing.

## Features

- **Matrix Initialization:** The program initializes a square matrix based on user input for its size (`n`) and the number of connections (`m`) between nodes.

- **Vector of Connections:** Utilizes a vector to store information about the connections between nodes in the matrix.

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Allocates memory for the matrix and vector dynamically based on the user-defined size.

- **Console Input/Output:** Uses system calls for console input (`scanf`) and output (`printf`) to interact with the user.

- **Matrix Display:** Displays the initialized matrix, showcasing the relationships between nodes.

- **Python Script for Running:** Included in the repository is a Python script (`script.py`) that simplifies the process of assembling and executing the assembly program. Run the script with the command `python script.py`.

## How to Use

1. Input the desired matrix size (`n`) and the number of connections (`m`) when prompted.

2. The program will then initialize the matrix and display it on the console.

3. Observe the relationships between nodes represented in the matrix.

## Prerequisites

- An x86 architecture machine or emulator capable of running assembly programs.
- Python installed for using the run script.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the Python script to assemble and execute the program.

```bash
python script.py
